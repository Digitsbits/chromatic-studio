# Verification record

Verified on 2026-10-21 with Node.js v24.19.0 and Chrome on Windows.

- Automated tests: 7/7 passed using `node --test`.
- Static build: passed using `node scripts/build.mjs`.
- Desktop and phone layouts visually inspected at requested 1440 × 1000 and 390 × 844 viewports. Captures are in `screenshots/`; City Chapters uses a desktop viewport capture because browser full-page stitching repeated regions.
- Phone document width matched its viewport; no horizontal overflow observed.
- Browser controls exercised: Preset change, palette save, typography change, undo, and saved-palette persistence after reload.
- Original SVG/CSS artwork; no external assets, analytics, API requests, runtime packages or development packages. Dependency lockfile contains no third-party dependencies. No package-vulnerability database audit was needed for an empty dependency graph; this is not a security certification.

## Verification limits

Browser download completion is not verified. The first CSS-export verification call timed out in browser tooling; it was not retried while its outcome was uncertain. Export formatting has automated coverage where documented in the tests. The repair photo picker was subsequently verified with a synthetic local PNG (64 by 64 pixels); blob preview decoding and removal passed. Clipboard success, rejection and missing-API fallback were tested through the actual callback in a local Node harness, without changing browser permissions. All five export payloads passed local checks; object export and photo validation callbacks also passed in-memory stub checks. Real clipboard permission behavior, assistive-technology review, and cross-browser behavior remain unverified. These are local fictional demos, not production services.
